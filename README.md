# Hi 👋, I'm Shreyas

**Electronics & Communication Engineer with a strong passion for digital electronics — building everything from logic gates to full CPUs on breadboards.**

- 🔧 I love designing low-level digital systems: **register files**, **ALUs**, **control units**, and **memory architectures**.
- 🌱 Currently exploring **Verilog HDL** to bridge hardware design with simulation and synthesis.
- 🧪 I build all logic manually — no microcontrollers or prebuilt CPUs — purely from ICs, D flip-flops, and hardwired logic.
- 📫 Reach me at: [skombinadka@gmail.com](mailto:skombinadka@gmail.com)
